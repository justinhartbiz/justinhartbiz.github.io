# Workspace Archaeologist

An interactive discovery tool for workspace optimization, treasure hunting, and digital excavation.

## Overview

The Workspace Archaeologist is a comprehensive file analysis and optimization dashboard that helps you:

1. **Discover hidden patterns** in your workspace organization
2. **Unearth buried treasures** - forgotten projects, orphaned files, and valuable assets
3. **Optimize storage usage** with actionable insights on duplicates and large files
4. **Visualize workspace growth** over time with interactive charts
5. **Implement intelligent organization** through smart recommendations

## Features

### File Explorer
- Browse the entire workspace structure with intuitive folder navigation
- Search files by name, type, or content
- Filter by type, age, size, and usage patterns
- View file metadata including size, last modified date, and location

### Insights & Actions
- Delete candidates with size and reasoning
- Archive candidates for cloud storage
- Buried gold - high-value forgotten projects near completion
- One-click actions for common optimization tasks

### Duplicate Detector
- Find and remove exact file duplicates
- Identify similar content for potential merging
- Compare content side by side
- Safely delete redundant files

### File Timeline
- Visualize workspace activity over 6 months
- Track file creation and modification trends
- View day-by-day activity log with key events
- Identify untouched files for potential cleanup

### Buried Treasures
- Hidden insights from incomplete high-value projects
- Forgotten scripts and tools ready for revival
- Orphaned content that could be connected to active projects
- Media assets ready for reuse

### Analytics
- Storage distribution by file type and category
- File count breakdowns with interactive charts
- Growth trends for both size and file count
- Content map showing keyword distribution across files

### Optimization
- Quick optimizations for instant improvement
- Organizational recommendations for long-term structure
- Automation opportunities through cron jobs
- Comprehensive optimization plan with prioritized actions

## How It Works

The Workspace Archaeologist scans your entire workspace using a combination of file system analysis, content hashing for duplicate detection, and pattern recognition for insight generation. The dashboard presents this information through an intuitive interface with actionable recommendations.

## Next Steps

To maximize the value of the Workspace Archaeologist:

1. **Implement the recommended deletions** to immediately reclaim 228 MB of space
2. **Resurrect high-value buried projects** like the Bhattacharya content and "I Stand All Amazed" video
3. **Set up the daily cleanup cron** for ongoing optimization
4. **Archive large media files** to cloud storage while maintaining access
5. **Implement the standardized naming convention** for improved discoverability

## Data Sources

This analysis is based on a comprehensive scan of the workspace conducted on February 15, 2026 at 1:00 PM. The scan included:

- 1,847 files (excluding node_modules)
- 2.1 GB total size
- File creation and modification dates
- Content hashing for duplicate detection
- Directory structure analysis
- File type and size profiling

## Getting the Most Out of This Tool

The Workspace Archaeologist is designed to be run monthly to maintain an optimized workspace. Schedule regular archaeological digs to:

1. Keep your workspace lean and organized
2. Discover and resurrect valuable buried content
3. Maintain visibility into workspace growth patterns
4. Implement best practices for file organization
