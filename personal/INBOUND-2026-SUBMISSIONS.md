## SUBMISSION #1: The Keynote Play

### Session Title
**The 90-Minute CMO: How I Replaced a 6-Person Workflow With AI Agents Running 24/7**

### Session Description (for attendees)
I'm a CMO managing fundraising campaigns across 12+ clients, a real estate pipeline, and a 22,000-subscriber publication. My workday used to be 6 hours of grinding — writing 50+ creative variants, analyzing campaign data, managing CRM workflows, and producing content across 4 platforms.

Then I built an AI operating system. Not ChatGPT prompts. An autonomous multi-agent system that writes, analyzes, publishes, and reports — while I sleep.

The result: my core creative work dropped from 5-6 hours to 90 minutes. My overnight agents produce data analyses I used to spend full days on. A live demo in our office had the CEO saying "I'm blown away" within 30 minutes.

In this session, I'll show you exactly what I built, what it costs, and how you can do it too — with specific tools, workflows, dollar amounts, and before/after metrics. No theory. No hype. Just the operating manual.

### What Will Attendees Learn? (3 Takeaways)
1. **The AI Agent Architecture** — How to set up a multi-model system (Claude + GPT + Gemini) where each model handles what it's best at, with autonomous agents running creative production, data analysis, and content distribution on schedules you define.

2. **The Compression Framework** — A step-by-step methodology for identifying which of your daily tasks can be automated vs. augmented vs. left alone, with real examples: 14-creative analysis packet → 4 minutes; 500-record CRM analysis → live dashboard; blog post → 5-platform distribution → done overnight.

3. **The ROI Math** — Exact costs ($200-400/month in AI subscriptions replacing $8,000-15,000/month in labor), implementation timeline (2 weeks to first agent, 90 days to full operating system), and the specific tools/platforms that make this possible today.

### Why You? (Speaker Credibility)
I'm a 25-year marketing operator — not an AI evangelist. VP at Surf Air, digital strategy for Romney's presidential campaign, Fortune 500 consulting, and currently CMO/Head of Creative managing high-volume direct-response campaigns.

Published author: "Gone Viral" (Regnery/Simon & Schuster, 2022). Newsletter: Rational Ground (22,000+ subscribers). Previous speaking: Dreamforce, MarTech Spring 2025.

I run AI in production every single day — multi-model agent orchestration, automated campaign workflows, real-time CRM integration, and content pipelines that produce from transcript to published article to social distribution autonomously. I've compressed 5-6 hour workdays to 90 minutes with measurable, documented results across fundraising, real estate, and media.

### Session Format
Breakout Session (45 min) — heavy on live demos and screen recordings of actual AI agent workflows in action. Attendees will leave with a downloadable "AI Operator Starter Kit" with tool recommendations, workflow templates, and a 30-day implementation roadmap.

## SUBMISSION #2: The Tactical Workshop Play

### Session Title
**3 Models, 1 Campaign: Inside a Real AI Creative Shootout That Outperformed Human-Only by 40%**

### Session Description (for attendees)
Every week, I run the same experiment: I give Claude, GPT, and Gemini the exact same creative brief — real campaign data, real donor psychology insights, real compliance constraints — and pit them against each other to produce SMS/MMS fundraising creative.

After 200+ shootouts across 12 clients, I've learned exactly what each model is good at, what it chokes on, and how to combine them into a creative process that consistently outperforms single-model or human-only workflows by 30-40% on yield-per-send.

This isn't a prompt engineering talk. It's a performance marketing talk that happens to use AI. I'll show you the scoring framework, the winning patterns, the data behind which archetypes convert — and how to build your own multi-model creative system in any vertical.

### What Will Attendees Learn? (3 Takeaways)
1. **Model Strengths Map** — Which AI model wins at what: Claude excels at emotional narrative and compliance-safe copy; GPT dominates multi-variant brainstorming and format flexibility; Gemini produces the most data-driven, benchmark-aware creative. You'll learn when to use each and how to combine outputs.

2. **The Creative Forensics Method** — How to analyze your own campaign history to extract the "10 Laws" of what makes your winning copy work — specific sentence structures, emotional triggers, voice patterns, and formatting choices that lift conversion rates, based on message-level analysis of 2,000+ real campaigns.

3. **Build Your Own Shootout System** — A replicable framework: brief template → multi-model generation → scoring rubric → A/B test design → performance feedback loop. Attendees get the actual templates, scoring sheets, and prompt architecture I use in production.

### Why You? (Speaker Credibility)
I manage creative production for political and nonprofit SMS/MMS campaigns that send to millions of donors monthly. My team's creative generates $1M+ in donations per client annually. I've personally analyzed 2,000+ campaign creatives with AI-assisted forensics to identify exactly what copy patterns drive conversions in direct-response fundraising.

Published author, 22,000+ newsletter subscribers, previous Dreamforce and MarTech speaker. I bring 25 years of direct-response marketing combined with daily AI production — every number in this talk comes from live campaigns, not lab experiments.

### Session Format
Breakout Session (45 min) — live comparison demos, real campaign data (anonymized where needed), and a downloadable Creative Shootout Toolkit with brief templates, scoring rubrics, and model-specific prompt strategies.
