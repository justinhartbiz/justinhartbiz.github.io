# TLH Agent OS External LLM Review Brief

## Objective
Review True Legacy Homes (TLH) business context + current Agent OS structure and recommend:
1. What’s missing
2. Better organization/taxonomy
3. Simpler framing for operators
4. Improvements to the live agents page so it’s easier to understand and execute

---

## TLH Business Context (Critical)
True Legacy Homes helps families in major life transitions (death, move-to-care, home disposition).

### Core model (must understand)
- **Estate Sales** are valuable but secondary (~7% of revenue)
- **Cash Home Purchases** are the economic engine (~93% of revenue)
- Signature value proposition: **“One Call. Two Checks.”**
  - Check #1: estate sale proceeds
  - Check #2: direct cash home offer

### Strategic requirement
All agent design and workflow recommendations should optimize for:
- Home purchase outcomes
- Speed + conversion quality
- Ethical trust-based positioning (not predatory language)

---

## Team + Agent Context
Current leadership/operators:
- Paul (CEO), Jeff (COO), Justin (CMO)
- Key team includes Tanya, Jaelynn, Jonathan, James, Tran, Brett, Debbie, Jason

Current Agent OS families:
- Command & Governance
- Brand & Demand
- Acquisition Inputs
- Conversion & Ops

Named agents include (examples): Maestro, Ledger, Atlas, Beacon, Scout, Postman, Piper, Grace, Echo, Ranger, Bridge, Concierge, Herald, StackOps, etc.

- Keep practical, operator-first

### C) Workflow Architecture
