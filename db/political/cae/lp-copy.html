<h2>They Flew Here to Steal Your Money.</h2>
<h3>Subhead</h3>
<p>Two men boarded a plane in Philadelphia — not for a vacation. They came to Minnesota to steal $3.6 million from Medicaid. <em>Your</em> Medicaid.</p>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>It sounds like a crime thriller. Two men from Philadelphia flew to Minnesota with one goal: exploit our state's Medicaid system for $3.6 million in fraudulent claims.</p>
<p>They didn't live here. They didn't work here. They didn't know a single patient. They simply identified Minnesota as an easy target — and helped themselves to millions in taxpayer-funded healthcare dollars.</p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>"Fraud Tourism"</strong> — where criminals treat Minnesota's safety net like an open vault.</p>
<p>And this isn't an isolated case. Federal investigators estimate that <strong>more than $10 billion</strong> in COVID-era fraud was siphoned out of Minnesota's public assistance programs. Billions. Gone. Stolen by organized networks that saw our state's lax oversight as an invitation.</p>
<p>That's money that should have gone to seniors who need home care. To children on MinnesotaCare. To families barely making ends meet.</p>
<p>Instead, it bought luxury cars, real estate, and plane tickets for out-of-state criminals.</p>
<p><strong>The fraud didn't happen because we lacked resources. It happened because no one was watching.</strong></p>
<p>Center of the American Experiment has been on the front lines — investigating the fraud, publishing the findings, and demanding accountability from the officials who let this happen.</p>
<p>But exposing a $10 billion scandal takes resources. It takes researchers, FOIA requests, data analysis, and the willingness to name names when politicians would rather move on.</p>
<h3>Ask</h3>
<p><strong>Fund the investigators who are exposing Minnesota's fraud crisis — before the next plane lands.</strong></p>

<h2>When Radicals Attack Law Enforcement, Who Stands Up?</h2>
<h3>Subhead</h3>
<p>In Minnesota, federal agents doing their jobs are being threatened — and local radicals are cheered on for it.</p>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>Here's what law and order looks like in Minnesota right now:</p>
<p>A group of activists at a yoga studio in the Twin Cities physically confronted ICE agents attempting to carry out a lawful enforcement action. They screamed. They blocked. They filmed themselves doing it — and posted it online like heroes.</p>
<p>The media called them "concerned citizens." Social media celebrated them. Local politicians stayed silent — or worse, sided with the mob.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>the men and women of ICE</strong> — federal officers enforcing laws passed by Congress — received <strong>direct threats</strong> for doing their jobs. Threats to their safety. Threats to their families.</p>
<p>Let that sink in.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, <strong>enforcing the law is now treated as the crime.</strong> And breaking it? That's activism.</p>
<p>This is what happens when radical ideology replaces common sense:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Law enforcement officers are targeted</strong> for upholding the law.</li>
<li><strong>Illegal activity is celebrated</strong> as moral courage.</li>
<li><strong>Public safety is sacrificed</strong> on the altar of ideological performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The yoga-studio meltdown wasn't a one-off. It's a symptom. Across Minnesota, a small but loud faction is working to make our state ungovernable — to turn every enforcement action into a confrontation, every officer into a villain, and every law into an obstacle.</p>
<p><strong>If no one pushes back, they win.</strong></p>
<p>Center of the American Experiment is the organization telling the truth about what's happening to public safety in Minnesota. We don't flinch. We don't spin. We investigate, we publish, and we hold the line — even when the mob comes for us too.</p>
<h3>Ask</h3>
<p><strong>Support the only organization in Minnesota willing to stand up for law enforcement and tell the truth about public safety.</strong></p>
