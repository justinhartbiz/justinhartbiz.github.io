<!-- VARIANT 1: ENFORCEMENT -->
<section class="variant">
  <div class="variant-label">Variant 1 — Enforcement</div>
  <img class="img-hero" src="images/enforcement-closed.png" alt="Closed clinic with legal notice">
  <h1>You Can Be the Reason a Dangerous Clinic Closes Forever.</h1>
  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Right now, unlicensed abortion facilities are operating across America with zero oversight. No inspections. No safety standards. Women are being injured — and no one is held accountable. State regulators look the other way while these facilities skirt the law.</p>

  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>Americans United for Life is the legal arm of the pro-life movement. Our attorneys draft model legislation, file legal challenges, and work state-by-state to force dangerous clinics to meet basic health and safety standards — or shut their doors for good. When AUL acts, facilities close. Permanently.</p>

  <h2>The Hero — You</h2>
  <p class="hero-text">Your gift shuts down lawless clinics.</p>
  <p>Every dollar funds the legal filings, the investigative research, and the legislative campaigns that force regulators to act. You can be the reason a dangerous facility closes forever — and the women in your community are finally protected.</p>

<!-- VARIANT 2: SCIENCE -->
<section class="variant">
  <div class="variant-label">Variant 2 — Science / Heartbeat</div>
  <img class="img-hero" src="images/science-ultrasound.png" alt="3D ultrasound of baby">
  <h1>You Can Be the Reason a Judge Sees the Heartbeat Evidence.</h1>
  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>The abortion industry spends millions to suppress basic science. They don't want judges, legislators, or the public to see what modern ultrasound technology reveals — a beating heart, functioning organs, a life responding to the world around it. They call it "tissue." Science says otherwise.</p>

  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>Americans United for Life brings the science into the courtroom. Our legal team files amicus briefs packed with peer-reviewed medical evidence. We partner with leading physicians and researchers to ensure that when a judge rules on life, they rule on facts — not ideology. AUL is why heartbeat laws survive legal challenges.</p>

  <h2>The Hero — You</h2>
  <p class="hero-text">Your gift defends the truth.</p>
  <p>You fund the expert witnesses, the medical research, and the legal briefs that put undeniable science in front of the judges who decide whether life is protected. You can be the reason a judge sees the heartbeat evidence — and rules in favor of life.</p>

<!-- VARIANT 3: ENEMY -->

  <h1>You Can Be the Reason Planned Parenthood Faces a Real Audit.</h1>
  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Planned Parenthood receives over $600 million in taxpayer funding every year — and operates with almost no financial accountability. Exposed for potential Medicaid fraud. Caught in billing scandals. Yet they continue to operate above the law, shielded by political allies who block every attempt at oversight.</p>

  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>Americans United for Life is done waiting. Our legal team is building the case — drafting model legislation for mandatory audits, supporting state attorneys general who want to investigate, and filing the legal actions that strip away Planned Parenthood's political immunity. When AUL targets an organization, the paper trail catches up.</p>

  <h2>The Hero — You</h2>
  <p class="hero-text">Your gift stops their immunity.</p>
  <p>You fund the legal research, the FOIA requests, the model legislation, and the courtroom battles that finally force Planned Parenthood to open its books. You can be the reason Planned Parenthood faces a real audit — and the truth comes out.</p>
