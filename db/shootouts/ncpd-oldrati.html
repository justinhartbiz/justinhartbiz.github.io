<div style="background:#1a1b23; border:1px solid #27272a; border-radius:8px; padding:16px; font-size:13px; line-height:1.7;">
  <p><strong style="color:#7c3aed;">Claude:</strong> Tight, punchy, credible. Consistently under MMS length target (254-274 chars vs 300-500 spec) but reads clean. Strong SMS hooks. Best "BREAKING" opener.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:8px;"><strong style="color:#10a37f;">GPT-4o:</strong> Significantly underbaked — all MMS under 250 chars, SMS thin on detail. Missed merge field syntax ([Friend] vs [firstname|Friend]). Weakest output by far.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:8px;"><strong style="color:#4285f4;">Gemini:</strong> Hit the MMS character targets (440-494). Most emotionally dense. Best Barbara voice. Solid SMS. Only model that fully followed the brief.</p>
