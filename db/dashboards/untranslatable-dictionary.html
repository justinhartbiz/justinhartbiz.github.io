const words=[
{word:'Komorebi',lang:'Japanese 木漏れ日',cat:'nature',meaning:'The interplay of light filtering through leaves — the dappled pattern of sunlight and shadow on the ground beneath trees.',cognitive:'English separates light, trees, and ground into distinct objects. This word perceives them as a single unified phenomenon — the relationship IS the thing. You\'re being asked to see a pattern as an entity.',tryit:'Go outside. Find dappled light under a tree. Try to see it not as "light coming through leaves" but as a single thing — a komorebi. Notice how your attention shifts from objects to the pattern between them.'},
{word:'Saudade',lang:'Portuguese',cat:'emotion',meaning:'A deep emotional state of melancholic longing for something or someone absent — tinged with the knowledge that what is missed may never return.',cognitive:'English has "nostalgia" and "longing" but neither carries the structural weight of knowing the absence is permanent. Saudade is grief without death, homesickness without a home to return to. It\'s an emotion about the structure of time itself.',tryit:'Think of a version of yourself from 10 years ago. Not with nostalgia — with the recognition that person is irretrievably gone. That specific feeling, before you name it as something else, is saudade.'},
{word:'Waldeinsamkeit',lang:'German',cat:'nature',meaning:'The feeling of being alone in the woods — not loneliness, but a specific quality of solitude that only forests produce.',cognitive:'English treats solitude as one thing. German recognizes that solitude IN A FOREST is a categorically different experience than solitude in a room or a desert. The container changes the emotion. This word says: location is an emotional variable.',tryit:'Next time you\'re in a wooded area alone, try to isolate the feeling that is specifically forest-solitude vs. generic aloneness. There IS a difference. This word names it.'},
{word:'Wabi-sabi',lang:'Japanese 侘寂',cat:'perception',meaning:'The aesthetic sensibility that finds beauty in imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness — cracked pottery, weathered wood, asymmetric arrangements.',cognitive:'English aesthetics default to symmetry, polish, completion. Wabi-sabi is a complete inversion: the crack IS the beauty. This isn\'t "appreciating flaws" — it\'s a fundamentally different theory of what beauty is.',tryit:'Find the oldest, most worn object in your home. Look at it not despite its wear but because of it. Try to see the wear patterns as more beautiful than the object was when new. If you can make that perceptual flip, you\'re doing wabi-sabi.'},
{word:'Tsundoku',lang:'Japanese 積ん読',cat:'social',meaning:'The act of acquiring books and letting them pile up unread.',cognitive:'English frames this as a failure — you "should" read them. Japanese names it as a distinct behavior pattern without judgment. The word\'s existence implies that accumulating unread books is a recognized human activity, not a deficiency.',tryit:'Look at your unread books/articles/bookmarks. Instead of feeling guilt, try to see the collection itself as the activity. You\'re not failing to read. You\'re tsundoku-ing. Notice how the guilt changes shape when the behavior has a name.'},
{word:'Mamihlapinatapai',lang:'Yaghan (Tierra del Fuego)',cat:'social',meaning:'A look shared between two people, each wishing the other would initiate something they both want but neither is willing to start.',cognitive:'English has no word for this mutual recognition of shared desire combined with mutual paralysis. The word captures a complete social dynamics equation in a single term — two agents, symmetric information, symmetric inhibition.',tryit:'Remember the last time you and someone else both wanted to say something but waited for the other to go first. That suspended moment of mutual recognition. English makes you describe the scenario. This word NAMES the moment itself.'},
{word:'Meraki',lang:'Greek μεράκι',cat:'perception',meaning:'Doing something with soul, creativity, and love — putting something of yourself into your work so that it carries your signature regardless of the medium.',cognitive:'English separates "work" from "self." Meraki says the boundary is permeable — that in certain states, the maker dissolves into the made. It\'s not passion (which is about intensity) but about permeability between person and product.',tryit:'Think of the last thing you made where you lost track of time. Not because it was fun — because the boundary between you and the work got thin. That specific dissolution is meraki.'},
{word:'Hygge',lang:'Danish',cat:'emotion',meaning:'A quality of coziness, warmth, and intimacy that involves candles, blankets, warm drinks — but is fundamentally about a feeling of safe togetherness or contented solitude.',cognitive:'English treats coziness as a property of objects (soft blanket, warm fire). Danish treats it as an atmospheric state that humans co-create. Hygge is not in the blanket — it\'s in the room. It\'s relational, not material.',tryit:'Tonight, create conditions for hygge: dim lights, warm drink, no screens. Notice the moment when "comfortable" tips into something more — a felt sense of safety in the present moment. Hygge is that tipping point.'},
{word:'Toska',lang:'Russian тоска',cat:'emotion',meaning:'A sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause — a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for.',cognitive:'English demands that suffering have an object: you\'re sad ABOUT something. Toska is objectless suffering — the soul aches without a referent. This word says: some forms of pain are structural, not situational.',tryit:'Wait for a moment of unexplained heaviness — not triggered by any event. Instead of searching for the cause (English reflex), try sitting with the causelessness. The discomfort of objectless ache, observed without diagnosis, is toska.'},
{word:'Jayus',lang:'Indonesian',cat:'social',meaning:'A joke so poorly told, so unfunny, that you can\'t help but laugh — not at the joke but at the failure of the joke.',cognitive:'English has "so bad it\'s good" but only for movies or art. Jayus isolates a specific social phenomenon: the inversion point where comedic failure becomes its own comedy. It names a phase transition in humor.',tryit:'Next time someone tells a terrible joke and you laugh anyway — not politely, but genuinely — notice that you\'re laughing at the structure of the failure, not the content. That laughter IS jayus.'},
{word:'Fernweh',lang:'German',cat:'emotion',meaning:'The opposite of homesickness — an ache for a place you\'ve never been. A longing for the distant and unknown.',cognitive:'English has "wanderlust" but that\'s about desire to travel. Fernweh is PAIN for an unknown destination. It says: you can be homesick for a place that was never home. This breaks the assumption that longing requires prior experience.',tryit:'Think of a place you\'ve never visited but feel pulled toward — not for vacation, but with an ache. Notice that the pull isn\'t rational. You can\'t miss what you\'ve never had — and yet. That impossibility is fernweh.'},
{word:'Ubuntu',lang:'Zulu/Xhosa',cat:'social',meaning:'"I am because we are." A philosophical concept that individual existence is fundamentally constituted by community — not enhanced by it, but made possible by it.',cognitive:'English treats individuals as the base unit who then choose to form groups. Ubuntu inverts the ontology: the group is primary, the individual is emergent. You don\'t JOIN a community — you EXIST THROUGH one.',tryit:'For one hour, try to identify which of your thoughts, preferences, and beliefs are genuinely yours vs. constituted by your communities. If Ubuntu is right, the question itself is malformed — there is no "yours" underneath.'}
