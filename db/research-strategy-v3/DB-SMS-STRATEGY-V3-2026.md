## High-Confidence Findings

### 1. MMS > SMS (41% Higher Conversion)
MMS messages with images/video had 41% higher donation conversion than plain SMS (0.103% vs 0.073%) [MissionWired/Tatango 2024]. However, SMS had 61% higher click-through and lower opt-out rates [MissionWired/Tatango 2024].

**Action:** Use MMS for major campaigns with compelling visuals. Use SMS for routine updates.

### 2. Evening Sends (8-9pm) Peak
Texts sent after 6pm had 37% higher conversion than daytime sends [MissionWired/Tatango 2024]. Peak conversion at 8-9pm was 0.205% vs ~0.06-0.095% in 6-8pm hours [MissionWired/Tatango 2024].

**Action:** Schedule critical fundraising texts for 8-9pm in recipient's timezone.

### 3. "Now or Never" Effect
Donors exhibit a "now-or-never" pattern — almost all gifts come immediately after the ask, not at the deadline [Damgaard & Gravert 2017]. Extending a donation deadline from 1 week to 1 month did not increase participation [Damgaard & Gravert 2017].

**Action:** Create urgency through content, not distant deadlines. Assume you have a one-minute window to convert.

### 4. Named Match = 39% Lift
Telling donors their gift would be matched by a trusted entity (Gates Foundation) increased donation likelihood by 39% and size by 44% vs anonymous match [Karlan & List via ideas42 2023]. Challenge/seed gifts boosted participation 23% [ideas42 2023].

**Action:** Always name the matching donor. "A generous alum will match your gift" beats "Your gift will be doubled."

### 5. "Thank You in Advance" Backfires
2025 RCT found that "thank you in advance" messaging triggers psychological reactance and decreases donations [Bruttel et al. 2025].

**Action:** BAN this phrase from all scripts. Thank AFTER the gift.

### 6. Out-Group Appeals Halve Donations
An explicit out-group appeal ("help a Roma child") halved the donation rate vs a generic ask in Greece [Linos et al. 2021]. In-group appeals showed no significant increase over generic [Linos et al. 2021].

**Action:** Use broad, universal narratives in cold SMS. Avoid divisive identity framing.

### 7. Timing > Frequency
Message recency to a deadline outweighs repetition frequency [Emerald Insight 2025].

**Action:** Shift from high-volume drip campaigns to climax-timed single sends.

### 8. Impact Receipts Drive 70.3% Retention
SMS detailing exactly where a donation was sent increased 12-month retention to 70.3% [Chell et al. 2018].

**Action:** Send operational "receipt" texts detailing the geographic impact of each gift.

## The 15 Most Defensible Findings

### Tier 1: High Strength (RCT Evidence)

1. **"Now or Never" Effect** — Donors act immediately or not at all [Damgaard & Gravert 2017]
2. **Out-Group Appeals Backfire** — Halved donation rates [Linos et al. 2021]
3. **"Thank You in Advance" Backfires** — Triggers reactance [Bruttel et al. 2025]
4. **"How" Beats "Why"** — Instructional framing outperforms abstract [Buttenheim et al. 2024]
5. **Timing > Frequency** — Recency to deadline beats repetition [Emerald Insight 2025]
6. **Impact Receipts** — 70.3% retention [Chell et al. 2018]
7. **Named Match = 39% Lift** — Credibility matters [ideas42 2023]

### Tier 2: Medium-High Strength

8. **MMS +41%** — Higher conversion but also higher opt-out [MissionWired 2024]
9. **Evening Sends 8-9pm** — 37% better than daytime [MissionWired 2024]
10. **Warm-Glow Crowding Out** — Sweepstakes depress core believers [Bénabou & Henkel 2024]
11. **iOS Silent Inbox** — Unknown senders routed to silent folder [L2 Data 2025]
12. **Loss Framing in Final 24h** — Outperforms gain framing [Kim & Hemphill 2024]
13. **Cultivation Before Conversion** — 53% CV boost from sequences [Tatango 2025]
14. **Wife/Spouse Voice (NCPD)** — 72% of top-tier creatives [DonorBureau 2026]
15. **Event Date Anchors** — $0.657/send, best in dataset [DonorBureau 2026]

### Conflict of Interest Note
Industry reports from SMS vendors (Tatango, AiSensy) may carry inherent bias favoring expanded messaging budgets. Academic RCTs offer highest causal validity. Triangulate with internal holdout testing.
