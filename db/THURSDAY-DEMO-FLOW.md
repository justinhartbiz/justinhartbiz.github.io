## The Script

### Intro (30 sec)
> "I wake up every morning, open the review page, and in about 10 minutes I've picked the winners for the day. Let me show you what that looks like."

---

### Step 1 — The Input (2 min)
**Show:** [SFL Review Page](https://justinhart.biz/db/nonprofit/sfl/SFL-REVIEW-2026-02-11.html)

**Talk track:**
- "This is today's actual review page for SFL."
- "Every creative is scored and tiered — Tier 1 is the best."
- "I check the boxes on the ones I want to run. That's it."
- "Notice: each creative has the model that wrote it, the prompt angle, and a preview."

**Key visual:** The checkbox selection UI. Simple. Fast.

---

### Step 2 — The Action (1 min)
**Show:** DB Dashboard tab (Drafts created)

**Talk track:**
- "I select winners, hit submit, and the system uploads them as drafts."
- "They show up in DB ready for QA and scheduling."
- "No copy-paste. No re-keying. Straight from AI generation → review → dashboard."

---

### Step 3 — The Brain (3 min)
**Show:** [NRSC Creative Forensics](https://justinhart.biz/db/forensics/nrsc-creative-forensics.html)

**Talk track:**
- "But how do we know what to tell the AI to write?"
- "We run forensics on every client. This is NRSC — hundreds of creatives analyzed."
- **Point out:**
  - **Yield Index** — normalizes for seasonality so you're comparing apples to apples
  - **10 Laws** — the rules the data tells us. Not opinions. Patterns.
  - **Voice analysis** — which senders perform, which don't
  - **Length sweet spots** — character count ranges that win
- "These laws feed directly back into the AI prompts. It's a flywheel."

**Optional deep dive (if time):** [Cr-1243 Case Study](https://justinhart.biz/db/nrsc/cr1243-case-study.html) — "$880K from one creative. Here's exactly why it worked."

---

### Step 4 — The Future (2 min)
**Show:** [Thunderdome / AI Creative Shootout Demo](https://justinhart.biz/speaking/ai-creative-shootout/demo/)

**Talk track:**
- "Where we're going — real-time AI vs AI creative battles."
- "Claude vs GPT vs Gemini, same brief, scored live."
- "The best creative strategy isn't picking one AI. It's making them compete."
