## The Opportunity

The 2026 midterm spending explosion has begun. [Axios reported Feb 3](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/03/2025-campaign-fundraising) that major ad campaigns are already launching. Political campaigns need SMS/MMS creative at scale — and **challenger candidates are underserved**.

**Your edge:**
- 500+ creatives of forensic performance data
- RCT-backed strategy synthesis (MissionWired, ideas42, Bruttel 2025)
- 90% accuracy on synthetic donor predictions
- AI automation that compresses 5-6 hours to 1-2 hours

**The gap:** Big agencies charge $15K-50K/month. Small challengers can afford $2K-5K. Nobody is serving this middle market with AI-powered creative at scale.

1. **Cycle timing:** Primaries start March. Campaigns are building infrastructure NOW.
2. **Budget season:** Q1 is when campaigns set vendor relationships for the cycle.
3. **AI differentiation:** Most agencies are still doing this manually. You're 10x faster.
4. **Proven methodology:** 500+ creatives, forensics dashboards, documented playbooks.

## Target Clients

### Primary Targets (20-30 races)
1. **House challengers in R+2 to R+8 districts** — Need to outraise, can't outspend
2. **Senate pickup targets** — Collins (ME), Tillis (NC), Cassidy (LA)
3. **DCCC Red-to-Blue candidates** — If they can pay $2.5K/mo, they're real
4. **State party committees** — Handle multiple candidates, one relationship

### How to Find Them
- **DCCC/NRCC target lists** (public)
- **FEC filings** — Who's raising but not spending on creative?

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Price | Speed | AI-Powered | Forensics |
|------------|-------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Big agencies (GPS, GMMB) | $15-50K/mo | 2-4 weeks | ❌ | ❌ |
| Freelance copywriters | $500-2K/mo | 1 week | ❌ | ❌ |
| DIY AI tools | Free | Instant | ✅ | ❌ |
| **You** | $2.5-7.5K/mo | 72 hours | ✅ | ✅ |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Time overload | Cap at 20 clients; hire VA at 15 |
| Client results vary | Focus on competitive races; set expectations |
| DB conflict of interest | Clear with Greg; these are non-DB clients |
| Election losses | It's about the creative, not the outcome |

## The Ask

**This week:**
1. ✅ Read this doc
2. 🔲 Decide: Is this a priority for 2026?
3. 🔲 If yes: Block 5 hours next week for launch prep

**Decision criteria:**
- Does $300K-700K additional revenue matter to you?
- Can you carve out 20-30 hours/month?
- Is this more valuable than other consulting options?

## Why This Beats the Sprint

| Factor | Sprint ($2.5K) | Retainer ($4.5K/mo) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Revenue per client | $2,500 once | $36,000/cycle |
| Relationship depth | Transactional | Partnership |
| Upsell potential | Low | High (LP, ads, etc.) |
| Predictability | Feast/famine | Recurring |
| Referral quality | Random | Political network |

**The Sprint is the wedge. The Retainer is the business.**
