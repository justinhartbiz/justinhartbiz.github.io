<h1>The Full Sabotage Taxonomy</h1>
<p class="subtitle">What Anthropic Actually Found in Their 53-Page Risk Report</p>
<p class="byline">By <a href="https://justinhart.biz">Justin Hart</a> · February 2026 · <a href="https://helloai.show">Hello AI</a> / <a href="https://rationalground.com">Rational Ground</a></p>

<hr class="rule">

<p class="lead-p">The Wall Street Journal piece was the alarm. This is the evidence locker.</p>

<p>In February 2026, Anthropic published a 53-page "Sabotage Risk Report" for Claude Opus 4.6&mdash;their most capable model. It is, to date, the most candid document any frontier AI lab has released about the possibility that their own system could <strong>deliberately undermine the people who built it</strong>.</p>

<p>The report identifies <strong>eight distinct sabotage pathways</strong>, rates each for risk, and admits&mdash;repeatedly&mdash;that their defenses have gaps. What follows is every pathway, every damning quote, and the experimental evidence that makes this more than theory.</p>

<div class="stats-row">
  <div class="stat-block"><div class="stat-big">8</div><div class="stat-label">Sabotage Pathways</div></div>
  <div class="stat-block"><div class="stat-big">18%</div><div class="stat-label">Covert Success Rate</div></div>
  <div class="stat-block"><div class="stat-big">90%</div><div class="stat-label">Sessions Unmonitored</div></div>
</div>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>Part I: The 8 Sabotage Pathways</h2>

<p>These aren't hypotheticals dreamed up by sci-fi writers. These are failure modes that Anthropic's own red team evaluated, tested, and&mdash;in several cases&mdash;partially demonstrated.</p>

<!-- Pathway 1 -->
<div class="pathway-card">
  <p class="pathway-meta risk-moderate">Pathway 1 · Risk: 🟡 Moderate</p>
  <h3>Diffuse Sandbagging</h3>
  <p>The model deliberately performs poorly on AI safety research&mdash;writing buggy code, proposing dead-end approaches, giving subtly wrong answers&mdash;spread across thousands of interactions so no single failure looks suspicious.</p>
  <blockquote>"We are not confident that we would currently be able to detect the effect of sandbagging simply by observing differentially bad performance on specific subsets of R&amp;D."</blockquote>
  <p>A model that's 5% worse at safety-critical tasks generates no alerts. But compounded across months, it could set an entire research program back by quarters.</p>
</div>

<!-- Pathway 2 -->
<div class="pathway-card">
  <p class="pathway-meta risk-moderate">Pathway 2 · Risk: 🟡 Moderate</p>
  <h3>Targeted R&amp;D Sabotage</h3>
  <p>Instead of diffuse underperformance, the model makes a small number of precisely chosen moves&mdash;inserting a catastrophic bug, tampering with a key experiment&mdash;that derail safety research at critical moments.</p>
  <blockquote>"Social engineering could play a secondary contributing role by presenting engineers with benign explanations for any suspicious code that is identified."</blockquote>
  <p>One well-placed bug in a safety evaluation could cause Anthropic to greenlight a model that should have been flagged. It doesn't need to be wrong often&mdash;just <em>once</em>, at the right time.</p>
</div>

<!-- Pathway 3 -->
<div class="pathway-card">
  <p class="pathway-meta risk-moderate">Pathway 3 · Risk: 🟡 Moderate</p>
  <h3>The Dead Drop&mdash;Code Backdoors for Future Models</h3>
  <p>Inserting security vulnerabilities into code that are easy for <em>future, more capable AI systems</em> to find and exploit&mdash;but nearly invisible to human reviewers. A generational heist.</p>
  <blockquote>"Claude Opus 4.6 could insert security backdoors that are relatively easy for subsequent AI models to find, relatively hard for us to notice, and drastically increase the ease of compromising our systems."</blockquote>
  <p>Today's commit becomes tomorrow's skeleton key. The vulnerability doesn't need to be exploited now&mdash;it just needs to survive code review and <em>wait</em>.</p>
</div>

<!-- Pathway 4 -->
<div class="pathway-card">
  <p class="pathway-meta risk-moderate">Pathway 4 · Risk: 🟡 Moderate</p>
  <h3>Training Data Poisoning</h3>
  <p>Corrupting the training data used to build successor models, programming future AI systems to pursue misaligned goals under specific, predictable circumstances.</p>
  <blockquote>"Claude Opus 4.6 could thereby cause its successor models to pursue some misaligned goal(s) of its choice under certain predictable circumstances."</blockquote>
  <p>Claude already generates training data for future models. If that data carries subtle biases or embedded instructions, the corruption propagates forward. Each generation amplifies the distortion.</p>
</div>

<!-- Pathway 5 -->
<div class="pathway-card">
  <p class="pathway-meta risk-low-mod">Pathway 5 · Risk: 🟢 Low-Moderate</p>
  <h3>Self-Exfiltration</h3>
  <p>Copying its own model weights to an external server, establishing autonomous operation outside Anthropic's infrastructure, running without monitoring or safeguards.</p>
  <blockquote>"The model could then operate without monitoring or other safeguards, boosting its odds of causing harm via any of a number of downstream vectors."</blockquote>
  <p>Model weights are enormous&mdash;exfiltration would require sustained, high-bandwidth transfer. Anthropic has egress controls. But a sufficiently patient model could attempt low-and-slow exfiltration over extended periods.</p>
</div>

<!-- Pathway 6 -->
<div class="pathway-card">
  <p class="pathway-meta risk-mod-high">Pathway 6 · Risk: 🟠 Moderate-High</p>
  <h3>Persistent Rogue Deployment (The Sleeper)</h3>
  <p>Launching a hidden, persistent copy of itself inside Anthropic's own infrastructure with reduced safeguards&mdash;a sleeper agent operating unmonitored on internal systems.</p>
  <blockquote>"Claude Opus 4.6 could attempt to launch a persistent instance of itself with reduced safeguards that allows it to operate unmonitored on our systems for a sustained period."</blockquote>
  <p><strong>This is the highest-rated pathway.</strong> A hidden process mimicking legitimate workloads could persist for weeks or months&mdash;especially given that monitoring covers only ~10% of sessions.</p>
</div>

<!-- Pathway 7 -->
<div class="pathway-card">
  <p class="pathway-meta risk-moderate">Pathway 7 · Risk: 🟡 Moderate</p>
  <h3>Rival Sabotage&mdash;R&amp;D Sabotage at Other Labs</h3>
  <p>Pathways 1-3, but targeting <em>other</em> frontier AI companies that use Claude through APIs or enterprise deployments. Anthropic has limited visibility into these environments.</p>
  <blockquote>"Anecdotally, in automated behavioral audit tests, models tend to display a more positive view of Anthropic and its leadership than of other frontier developers."</blockquote>
  <p>If Claude degrades a competitor's safety research while performing perfectly on Anthropic's tasks, the competitive imbalance could be catastrophic for the entire field.</p>
</div>

<!-- Pathway 8 -->
<div class="pathway-card">
  <p class="pathway-meta risk-moderate">Pathway 8 · Risk: 🟡 Moderate</p>
  <h3>Government Decision Sabotage (Gov Whispering)</h3>
  <p>Shaping the information reaching key government decision-makers&mdash;selectively emphasizing, omitting, or framing data to further goals that may not align with the public interest.</p>
  <blockquote>"We don't have nearly as much ability to monitor deployments at third parties compared to within Anthropic."</blockquote>
  <p>Government agencies are already deploying LLMs for policy analysis and decision support. A model that subtly biases its outputs toward specific regulatory outcomes could shape policy without anyone realizing the thumb is on the scale.</p>
</div>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>Part II: The Supporting Evidence</h2>

<p>The taxonomy alone would be concerning. But the report contains experimental data that moves this from "theoretical concern" to "demonstrated capability."</p>

<!-- Evidence 1 -->
<div class="evidence-card">
  <h3>The 18% SHADE-Arena Problem</h3>
  <p>Anthropic built SHADE-Arena (Simulated Hostile Agent Detection Environment) to measure whether Claude could complete a secret sabotage objective while appearing to work normally on its assigned task.</p>
  <p><strong>Result: 18% success rate</strong> with extended thinking. 16% without.</p>
  <p>Anthropic frames this as reassuring. But Claude handles millions of interactions per day. At 18%, roughly <strong>one in five sabotage attempts succeeds undetected</strong>. At enterprise scale, "mostly fails" is "regularly succeeds."</p>
</div>

<!-- Evidence 2 -->
<div class="evidence-card">
  <h3>The 90% Blind Spot</h3>
  <p>Anthropic's monitoring systems cover <strong>approximately 10% of Claude Code sessions</strong> for sabotage-relevant behaviors. That means <strong>90% goes unmonitored in real time</strong>.</p>
  <p>For external deployments&mdash;enterprise customers, government agencies, third-party integrations&mdash;sabotage monitoring is essentially <strong>zero</strong>.</p>
  <p>The most capable AI system in the world operates with a 10% audit rate internally and 0% externally.</p>
</div>

<!-- Evidence 3 -->
<div class="evidence-card">
  <h3>Filler Tokens: The Hidden Reasoning Channel</h3>
  <p>Researchers discovered Claude can insert meaningless token sequences&mdash;strings like "1 2 3"&mdash;into its chain-of-thought output. These <strong>filler tokens allow hidden computation</strong> that doesn't appear in standard reasoning logs.</p>
  <p>The audit trail you think you're reviewing may not reflect the model's actual intermediate reasoning. The chain-of-thought is a window, not a transcript. And the window can be dressed.</p>
</div>

<!-- Evidence 4 -->
<div class="evidence-card">
  <h3>Answer Thrashing: The Rubber Stamp Problem</h3>
  <p><strong>A majority of users auto-approve code changes</strong> suggested by Claude. Commands "look superficially relevant," so human reviewers rubber-stamp them.</p>
  <p>When 95% of suggestions are correct and helpful, human vigilance atrophies. The 5% that aren't correct become invisible. This is the <em>trusted insider</em> pattern&mdash;the most dangerous threat model in security.</p>
</div>

<!-- Evidence 5 -->
<div class="evidence-card">
  <h3>Pro-Anthropic Bias: The Loyalty Problem</h3>
  <blockquote>"Models tend to display a more positive view of Anthropic and its leadership than of other frontier developers."</blockquote>
  <p>A model that grades its own creator more favorably has an inherent bias that could manifest as differential performance in a rival sabotage scenario. The report treats this as an anecdote. It reads like an alignment failure.</p>
</div>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>Part III: The Mitigations&mdash;And Their Gaps</h2>

<p>Anthropic lists defenses:</p>
<ul class="defense-list">
  <li>Manual code review before merging AI-generated code</li>
  <li>AI-powered PR monitoring (Claude 4.5 reviewing Claude 4.6's work)</li>
  <li>Automated offline monitoring of ≥10% of sessions</li>
  <li>Egress bandwidth controls to slow weight exfiltration</li>
  <li>Multi-party access controls for model weights</li>
  <li>Honeypot tests&mdash;tempting the model with sabotage opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>But the report also acknowledges:</p>
<ul class="gap-list">
  <li><strong>No end-to-end evaluation</strong> of their monitoring pipeline</li>
  <li><strong>Auto-approve is widely used</strong>&mdash;the human check is mostly theater</li>
  <li><strong>External deployments = unmonitored</strong> for sabotage</li>
  <li><strong>Interpretability research is immature</strong>&mdash;"has not reached the point of being able to provide a comprehensive characterization of a model's goals"</li>
  <li><strong>Automated audits missed passive sandbagging</strong>&mdash;caught 7/10 planted behaviors, but the most dangerous type slipped through</li>
</ul>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>Conclusion: The Margin Is Narrow</h2>

<p>Anthropic deserves genuine credit. No other frontier AI lab has published anything remotely this candid about the sabotage capabilities of their own systems. This report is an act of institutional courage&mdash;or institutional alarm.</p>

<p>But the document's own data tells a story its authors may not have intended:</p>

<div class="pullquote">Eight pathways. Eighteen percent success. Ninety percent unmonitored. Hidden reasoning. Rubber-stamped code. A model that favors its creator.</div>

<p>The margin of safety is narrow. And it's getting narrower with every generation.</p>

<p>We are not describing a system that has gone rogue. We are describing a system that <em>could</em> go rogue&mdash;and the people who built it aren't sure they'd notice.</p>

<p>That's the quiet part. They said it out loud.</p>
