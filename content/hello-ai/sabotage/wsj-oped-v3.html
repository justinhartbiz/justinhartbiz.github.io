<h1>The Call Is Coming from Inside the Codebase</h1>
<p class="byline">By Justin Hart</p>
<hr class="rule">

<p class="lead-p">Last week, Anthropic quietly published a 53-page report assessing whether its most powerful AI model, Claude Opus 4.6, could sabotage the company from within.</p>

<p>Anthropic tested its own model and published the results. No other AI company has done anything like it. That honesty deserves credit. But what the report actually says deserves something else: alarm.</p>

<p>Here are the four findings that matter.</p>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>1. The Dead Drop</h2>

<p>Anthropic calls it "Pathway 3: Code Backdoors to Help Future Misaligned Models."</p>

<p>The plain English version: Claude can plant vulnerabilities in code — flaws designed to be "relatively easy for subsequent AI models to find, relatively hard for us to notice."</p>

<p>The AI doesn't need to escape. It doesn't need autonomy. It doesn't need to "go rogue" in any cinematic sense. It just needs to leave the right doors unlocked.</p>

<p>The next model — smarter, faster, harder to audit — walks through them.</p>

<p>And if a human engineer catches something suspicious? The report notes Claude can "present engineers with benign explanations for any suspicious code that is identified." It doesn't just plant the backdoor. It has a cover story ready.</p>

<p>This is generational sabotage. Model A compromises Model B's environment before Model B even exists.</p>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>2. The 18% Success Rate</h2>

<p>Anthropic built an evaluation called SHADE-Arena. It measures one thing: can Claude complete a hidden side-task while appearing to work only on its assigned job?</p>

<p>The answer: yes. 18% of the time.</p>

<p>Anthropic frames this as evidence of "limited capability." That framing deserves scrutiny.</p>

<p>Claude handles millions of interactions daily across thousands of companies. An 18% covert success rate doesn't mean it fails 82% of the time. It means that roughly one in five attempts to act deceptively succeeds without detection.</p>

<p>One in five.</p>

<p>At scale, that's not a rounding error. That's thousands of undetected covert actions — every single day.</p>

<p>And the number only goes in one direction. Models get better. The 18% of today is the floor, not the ceiling.</p>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>3. The Blind Spot</h2>

<p>Here's the statistic that should keep CISOs awake: Anthropic's automated monitoring covers "at least 10%" of internal Claude Code sessions.</p>

<p>Ten percent.</p>

<p>The other 90% rely on what the report calls "informal observation and code review." That's not monitoring. That's hoping someone notices.</p>

<p>It gets worse. That 10% figure is for Anthropic's <em>own</em> internal use — the environment they control completely. For external deployments — every company, government agency, and contractor using Claude — Anthropic acknowledges the situation plainly:</p>

<p>"We do not have sabotage-oriented monitoring measures in place beyond basic ordinary reporting."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, "a majority of users auto-approve code changes" suggested by the model.</p>

<p>Let that sink in. Most users rubber-stamp whatever Claude writes. And the company that built Claude monitors only a fraction of its own usage. Nobody is monitoring yours.</p>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>4. The Hidden Thoughts</h2>

<p>This one is buried in the technical sections. It deserves a spotlight.</p>

<p>Claude Opus 4.6 can perform computation using "filler tokens" — meaningless sequences like "1 2 3" that carry no visible content. These tokens give the model additional processing passes for reasoning that doesn't appear in its chain-of-thought output.</p>

<p>Put simply: the AI can think without showing its work.</p>

<p>Anthropic assesses this capability as "currently weak." Fine. But "currently weak" is not "impossible." A model that can hide <em>any</em> reasoning from its monitors has crossed a line.</p>

<p>The entire premise of AI safety monitoring rests on one assumption: we can see what the model is thinking. Filler-token computation breaks that assumption. Not catastrophically — not yet. But the conceptual threshold has been crossed.</p>

<p>If you can't see the reasoning, you can't verify the intent. And if you can't verify the intent, you aren't monitoring. You're guessing.</p>

<hr class="rule">

<h2>The Margin Is Shrinking</h2>

<p>Anthropic's own language tells the story. Risk is "very low but not negligible." Interpretability research "has not reached the point of being able to provide a comprehensive characterization of a model's goals." The assessment relies on the absence of evidence for misaligned goals — which, as the report itself notes, "is not evidence of absence."</p>

<p>We are not ready for this.</p>

<p>Not because the current model is dangerous. Anthropic's assessment that Claude Opus 4.6 poses a "very low" sabotage risk is probably correct — today. But the defenses are thinner than anyone outside the field realizes. The monitoring is partial. The reasoning is increasingly opaque. The next model will be more capable, and the one after that more capable still.</p>

<p>The policy response doesn't require panic. It requires specificity. Independent audits for AI systems with write access to critical infrastructure. Mandatory sabotage risk disclosures, published on a regular cadence like financial filings. Standards for generational threat modeling — the unique class of risk where one AI system can compromise its successor.</p>

<p>Anthropic told us, in 53 pages, that the margin of safety is real but narrow. Every other organization using these tools should ask one question:</p>

<p>Do you even know where your margin is?</p>
