# The Operator Toolkit

> Ten asymmetric ideas generated from full workspace excavation. High-leverage tools for operators, strategists, and decision-makers.

## Overview

The Operator Toolkit is a suite of 10 high-leverage tools designed to create asymmetric returns: small inputs, outsized outputs. Each tool represents a unique approach to solving complex problems across marketing, decision-making, content creation, and business strategy.

## The 10 Ideas

1. **Donor Genome Project** 🧬 — Open-source grammar of persuasion from 5,581 creatives
2. **Kolob Engine** ✨ — Immersive AI scripture experiences (hymns + video + genealogy)
3. **Extinction Index** 💀 — Live dashboard scoring companies by AI displacement risk
4. **Campaign-Grade Parenting** 👨‍👧‍👦 — "I run 9 kids like a campaign war room" framework
5. **GraphRG** 🧠 — Fine-tune model that reasons like Justin (replace dead Dante)
6. **The Objection Machine** 🛡️ — Universal objection mapper for any proposition
7. **The Archetype Casino** 🎰 — Viral quiz from synthetic donor archetypes
8. **The Decision Tape** 🎙️ — Voice-logged reasoning archive with pattern detection
9. **Newsroom in a Box** 📰 — Open-source publishing ops stack
10. **Wyld Stallyns Inverted** ⚡ — Place yourself in history's hardest decisions

## Why These Tools Matter

These ideas exist at the intersection of high impact and unique insight — concepts that are non-obvious but immediately useful once implemented. They're designed for asymmetric returns, creating outsized impact relative to the effort invested.

## Combinations & Workflows

While each tool is designed to stand alone, they work even better in combination:

- The **Donor Genome** can feed the **Archetype Casino**
