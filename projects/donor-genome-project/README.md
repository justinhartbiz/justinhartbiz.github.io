# Donor Genome Project 🧬

*An open-source grammar of persuasion extracted from 5,581 creatives across 7 clients*

## Overview

The Donor Genome Project is a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that reveals the DNA of successful fundraising language. By analyzing patterns across thousands of high-performing creatives, we've extracted the core elements that drive donations and engagement.

This project transforms the Creative Genome (internal analysis) into an open-source tool that any fundraiser or marketer can use to improve their persuasive copy.

## Key Features

- **DNA Patterns Library**: Core building blocks of persuasive fundraising copy
- **Copy Analyzer**: Test your fundraising messages against the genome database
- **Persuasion Framework**: The universal 5-part structure for high-converting copy
- **Power & Poison Words**: Specific words and phrases that drive or kill performance
- **Client DNA Profiles**: Unique persuasion signatures for each audience segment
- **Research Data**: Transparent methodology and dataset overview

## Research Base

- 5,581 creatives analyzed across 7 clients
- Political (2,933) and nonprofit (1,324) segments
- Revenue analysis: $8M+ in donations
- Cross-client pattern validation
- Negative analysis (what losers have in common)

## Universal Laws

1. **Personalization tokens help** (r=0.041-0.089)
2. **Questions hurt** (negative in all 7 clients analyzed)
3. **A person beats an organization** (named sender > organizational voice)
4. **Specific beats generic** ("December 14" > "this holiday season")
5. **Short-medium beats long** (1000+ chars = death zone)

## The Home-Run Reality

| Metric | Top 10% | Top 1% | Bottom 75% |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Revenue Share | 95.1% | 54.6% | <5% |
| Creatives That Scale | 24.1% | 6.7% | 75.9% tested once |

This is a home-run game. Optimize for finding monsters, not incrementally improving average creatives.
