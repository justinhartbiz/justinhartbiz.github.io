  <h1>Aphantasia</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">3% of people cannot picture anything in their mind — and most of them never knew it wasn't universal until 2015.</p>
</header>
<main>
  <div class="mind-blow">
    <div class="big">Close your eyes. Picture an apple.</div>
    <p>For most people, an image appears. For roughly 1 in 30 people, there is only darkness — and they assumed that's what "picturing" meant for everyone.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>What Is Aphantasia?</h2>
  <p>Aphantasia is the inability to voluntarily visualize mental imagery. The word was coined in 2015 by neurologist Adam Zeman after a patient reported losing the ability to "see" things in his mind after a minor surgical procedure. When Zeman published his findings, he was flooded with responses from people who had never been able to visualize — and had no idea this was unusual.</p>
  <p>The discovery revealed something startling: a fundamental aspect of human cognition varies so dramatically between individuals that some people have spent entire lives not realizing their inner experience was different from everyone else's.</p>

  <h2>The Spectrum of Mental Imagery</h2>
  <p>Visualization exists on a spectrum. Take this diagnostic test used by researchers:</p>

  <div class="test-box">
    <h3>🍎 The Apple Test — Where Are You?</h3>
    <p style="color:#9b8ec4;margin-bottom:16px;font-size:.9rem">Close your eyes. Think of an apple. Which description best matches what you experience?</p>
    <div class="spectrum">
      <div class="spectrum-item" onclick="selectSpectrum(this,'hyperphantasia')">
        <div class="label">Hyperphantasia</div>
        <div class="desc">Vivid as real life. I can see the shine, the color, the stem — it's almost photographic.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="spectrum-item" onclick="selectSpectrum(this,'vivid')">
        <div class="label">Vivid</div>
        <div class="desc">Clear image, not photographic but definitely there — I can describe color, shape, texture.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="spectrum-item" onclick="selectSpectrum(this,'vague')">
        <div class="label">Vague</div>
        <div class="desc">Something is there — a sense of apple — but it's fuzzy, more concept than image.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="spectrum-item" onclick="selectSpectrum(this,'none')">
        <div class="label">Aphantasia</div>
        <div class="desc">Nothing. Pure darkness. I know what an apple is, but there's no image whatsoever.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="result-box"></div>
  </div>

  <h2>The Numbers</h2>
  <p>
    <span class="stat">~3% have complete aphantasia</span>
    <span class="stat">~24% have weak imagery</span>
    <span class="stat">~3% have hyperphantasia</span>
    <span class="stat">Slightly more common in men</span>
    <span class="stat">Often runs in families</span>
  </p>

  <h2>What Aphantasics Can and Cannot Do</h2>
  <p>Here's what makes this genuinely strange: aphantasics are not cognitively impaired. Many are highly successful — scientists, engineers, writers, artists. They can describe objects perfectly well, solve spatial problems, and remember facts. What they can't do is see things in their mind's eye.</p>
  <p>They also cannot experience mental imagery in dreams the same way — many report dreaming in concepts or narratives rather than images. They can feel nostalgia without a visual "flashback." They can fall in love without picturing their partner's face.</p>

  <blockquote>"I thought 'picture this in your mind' was just an expression, like 'break a leg.' I had no idea people were actually seeing things." — Common aphantasic account</blockquote>

  <h2>The Neuroscience</h2>
  <p>Brain imaging studies show that when typical people visualize, the visual cortex activates — the same regions that process what you actually see. In aphantasics, this activation is absent or severely reduced during voluntary visualization tasks. The visual cortex works fine for real visual input; it simply doesn't respond to imagination.</p>
  <p>One leading hypothesis: the feedback signal from higher cognitive areas to the visual cortex — the signal that says "render this image" — is either weak or absent in aphantasia. The knowledge is there. The rendering engine is disconnected.</p>

  <h2>The Philosophical Puzzle</h2>
  <p>Aphantasia opens a profound question about the relationship between language and experience. When someone says "I can picture it," "I see what you mean," or "imagine if..." — are these metaphors for aphantasics, or do they experience something functionally equivalent but phenomenologically different?</p>
  <p>It suggests that much of our shared vocabulary for mental life may paper over enormous variation in actual inner experience. If people differ this dramatically in visual imagination, what other dimensions of cognition vary in ways we haven't discovered yet?</p>
  <p>The discovery of aphantasia is less than a decade old. We don't yet know what else we've been assuming was universal that isn't.</p>

const results = {
  hyperphantasia: "You're a hyperphantasic — your mental imagery is unusually vivid, almost indistinguishable from real perception. About 3% of people share this. Some find it so vivid it can be intrusive.",
  vivid: "You have typical-to-vivid mental imagery. Most people fall here — the image is clearly present but obviously mental, not perceptual.",
  vague: "You're in the 'low vividness' range — perhaps around 24% of people. The concept is present, the image is dim. Functional but not photographic.",
  none: "You may have aphantasia. If there was truly nothing — no image at all, only abstract knowledge of 'apple' — you're among roughly 3% of people. You've likely spent years using visual metaphors ('picture this') not knowing they described something you weren't actually doing."
