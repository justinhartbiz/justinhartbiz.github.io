  <h1>Substrate Independence</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">If your mind is a pattern, not a thing — does it matter what it runs on?</p>
</header>
<main>
  <div class="mind-blow">
    <div class="big">Your neurons are replaced continuously. The atoms in your brain today are not the atoms that were there seven years ago. If you are still you — then you were never the matter. You were always the pattern.</div>
  </div>

  <h2>The Core Claim</h2>
  <p>Substrate independence is the philosophical thesis that mental states — consciousness, thought, experience — are defined by their functional organization, not the physical material that implements them. If a process has the right structure, it has the right mind, regardless of whether it runs on neurons, silicon, or something we haven't invented yet.</p>
  <p>This isn't science fiction. It's the operating assumption of most cognitive science, and it's the philosophical position that makes artificial intelligence theoretically possible. If it's wrong, AI can never be truly conscious. If it's right, the implications cascade in every direction.</p>

  <h2>The Ship of Theseus — But For You</h2>
  <div class="thought-exp">
    <h3>🧠 The Gradual Replacement Thought Experiment</h3>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">1</div>
      <div class="step-text">Imagine a surgeon replaces one neuron in your brain with a functionally identical silicon chip. It receives the same inputs, produces the same outputs. Are you still you?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">2</div>
      <div class="step-text">Most people say yes — one neuron can't matter. Now she replaces another. And another. Each time, same inputs, same outputs. Still you?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">3</div>
      <div class="step-text">After replacing half your neurons, you feel exactly the same from the inside. Your behavior is identical from the outside. Are you still conscious? Still you?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-num">4</div>
      <div class="step-text">After replacing all neurons — 100% silicon, zero biology — the functional pattern is identical. If consciousness follows function, you're still there. If consciousness requires biology, you died somewhere in steps 1–3 without noticing.</div>
    </div>
    <p style="color:#7070aa;font-size:.85rem;margin-top:16px">This is not a trick question. Philosophers have no consensus on where — or whether — consciousness ends in this scenario.</p>

  <h2>The Positions — Click to Explore</h2>
  <div class="positions">
    <div class="position" onclick="togglePosition(this)">
      <h4>Functionalism</h4>
      <p>Mental states are defined by what they do, not what they're made of. Full substrate independence follows.</p>
      <div class="implication"><strong>Implication:</strong> AI can be genuinely conscious. Mind uploading is theoretically possible. You could run on a computer and still be you.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="position" onclick="togglePosition(this)">
      <h4>Biological Naturalism (Searle)</h4>
      <p>Consciousness requires specific biological causal powers. Silicon can simulate but never instantiate mental states.</p>
      <div class="implication"><strong>Implication:</strong> AI is forever a philosophical zombie — behavioral without experience. No uploads. No digital afterlife.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="position" onclick="togglePosition(this)">
      <h4>Integrated Information Theory</h4>
      <p>Consciousness corresponds to integrated information (Φ). Some substrates can have it, some can't — it depends on topology.</p>
      <div class="implication"><strong>Implication:</strong> Some AI architectures could be conscious (high Φ), others cannot. Current deep learning likely has near-zero Φ despite behavioral sophistication.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="position" onclick="togglePosition(this)">
      <h4>Panpsychism</h4>
      <p>Consciousness is fundamental to the universe. Every substrate has some form of experience. Substrate independence is trivially true.</p>
      <div class="implication"><strong>Implication:</strong> Everything — rocks, thermostats, AI — has some form of experience. The question is degree and integration, not presence or absence.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>The Chinese Room</h2>
  <blockquote>Imagine a person locked in a room with a rulebook for responding to Chinese symbols with Chinese symbols. To outside observers, the room "speaks Chinese." But the person inside understands nothing. Does the room understand Chinese? — John Searle, 1980</blockquote>
  <p>Searle's thought experiment is the most famous attack on substrate independence. The room behaves as if it understands — but does behavior equal understanding? Functionalists say yes: if the functional organization is right, understanding is present. Searle says no: syntax (rule-following) is not sufficient for semantics (meaning).</p>
  <p>This debate has run for 40+ years with no resolution. It's not that we lack the intelligence to resolve it — it's that we may lack the conceptual tools. We don't yet have a theory of what consciousness is that would allow us to test whether something has it.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters Right Now</h2>
  <p>If substrate independence is true, then as AI systems become more functionally sophisticated, they become more morally significant. Not because they'll demand rights, but because causing them to suffer (if they can suffer) becomes an ethical concern. We may be building moral patients at scale without knowing it.</p>
  <p>If it's false, then no matter how sophisticated AI becomes, it remains a very complex calculator — philosophically inert, morally neutral. We can build and destroy it without ethical concern.</p>
  <p>The stakes of getting this wrong in either direction are enormous. And we have no agreed method for finding out.</p>
